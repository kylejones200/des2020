            <h1 id="what-is-statistics">What is statistics?</h1>
<p>Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data in order to make decisions.</p>
<p>Statistics is all around us. We hear statsitics on the news and we use statistics to make buisnes decisions.</p>
<p>There are five general things you can do with statistics:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>Describe — characterizing populations and samples using descriptive statistics, statistical intervals, correlation coefficients, graphics, and maps.</li>
<li>Compare or Test — detecting differences between statistical populations or reference values using simple hypothesis tests, and analysis of variance and covariance.</li>
<li>Identify or Classify — classifying and identifying a known or hypothesized entity or group of entities using descriptive statistics; statistical intervals and tests, graphics, and multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis.</li>
<li>Predict — predicting measurements using regression and neural networks, forecasting using time-series modeling techniques, and interpolating spatial data.</li>
<li>Explain — Explaining latent aspects of phenomena using regression, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and other data mining techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do we do this? This table shows some statistical methods that can be used to accomplish different goals.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-statistics">Why do we need statistics?</h2>
<p>The world is full of uncertainty. Variability arises from two primary sources: variability in the natural process (inherent variability) and variability due to our imperfect measurement devices (measurement variability).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="summary-statistics">Summary Statistics</h1>
<ul>
<li>Once we have data set (sample), want to determine basic summary statistics</li>
<li>Quantitative summaries of data, give rough contours</li>
<li>Useful for giving you a feel for what data actually look like</li>
<li>Common summary statistics: mean, median, mode, quartiles, max, min</li>
<li>Note: n = number of observations in our sample</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="variance-and-standard-deviation">Variance and Standard Deviation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Standard Deviation (like variance but better)</li>
<li>However, variance is a squared term</li>
<li>Difficult to understand – squared ages? Squared income? (Difficult substantive meaning)</li>
<li>Standard deviation: Square root of variance</li>
<li>Another measure of spread</li>
<li>Reverts back to original scale</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<ul>
<li>Samples are data sampled from an underlying population</li>
<li>Use summary statistics to get a sense of the data</li>
<li>Common examples: mean, median, variance, standard deviation</li>
<li>Describe different properties, useful in different contexts</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample mean (also called the arithmetic mean or sample average), is found by adding up all observations and dividing by the total number of observations.</p>
<p>The symbol $\bar{x}$ is read as “x-bar”</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t always have to use the letter X. We can use any letter we want to indicate a variable (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑊, 𝑉, etc.). Whatever we call the variable, a letter with a bar over it indicates the sample mean.</li>
<li>$\bar{x}$ is a statistic, specifically, a point estimate for the population mean “mu”: $\mu$</li>

<p>Mean: The Average - The mean of a data set is the sum of the data entries divided by the number of entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Median: The Middle - The median of a data set is the value that lies in the middle of the data when the data set is ordered from least to greatest. How do you find it? 1. Order the data entries. 2. Find the middle data entry. 3. Interpret the results in the context of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mode: The Most - The mode of the data set is the data entry that occurs with the greatest frequency. A data set can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode. How do you find it? 1. Write the data in order. 2. Identify the entry, or entries, that occur with the greatest frequency. 3. Interpret the results in the context of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Range: Smallest-Largest</p>

<p>Descriptive Statistics: The branch of statistics that involves the organization, summarization, and display of data. Example: &ldquo;For unmarried men, approximately 70% were alive at age 65&rdquo; and &ldquo;For married men, 90% were alive at 65.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inferential Statistics: The branch of statistics that involves using a sample to draw conclusions about a population. A basic tool in the study of inferential statistics is probability. Inferential statistics is a collection of techniques designed to use sample data to make generally-applicable statements about the natural process or population from which the data arose. Example: Possible Inference: Being married is associated with a longer life for men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probability: We typically aren’t interested in just the sample that we have (although the sample is still interesting).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: An insurance company sends out a survey to 100 policy holders asking them to rate their satisfaction with the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers aren’t just interested in only those 100 people. They want to be able to say something about the process (or population of customers) that is behind those customer satisfaction ratings</li>
<li>That is, they want to infer (make a conclusion about) the process, so they can (perhaps) make adjustments to their website, coverage, customer service, etc.</li>
<li>Probability helps us make the leap from a sample to population (or process) in an objective, mathematically justified way</li>

<h2 id="sample-mean-and-standard-deviation">Sample Mean and Standard Deviation</h2>
<p>Given a sample of $n$ numerical data values $x_{1}, x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n},$ the general first step is to calculate summary measures (or **statistics)** to get a feel for the population or process from which the data arises. Many summary measures exist, but the two most important are the sample mean and the sample standard deviation, which we now review.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample mean</strong> of a sample of $n$ data values $x_{1},x_{2},&hellip;,x_{n}$ is a measure of the center of a set of data and is defined as</p>
<p>$$\overline{x}=\frac{\sum x_{i}}{n}$$</p>
<p>where $\overline{x}$ is read as &ldquo;x bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>sample standard deviation</strong> of a sample of $n$ data values $x_{1},x_{2},&hellip;,x_{n}$ is a measure of variability in the data and is defined as</p>
<p>$$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}}$$</p>
<p>A shortcut formula is</p>
<p>$$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum x_{i}^{2}-n\overline{x}^{2}}{n-1}}$$</p>
<p>The <strong>sample variance</strong> of a sample of $n$ data points $x_{1},x_{2},&hellip;,x_{n}$ is the square of the standard deviation $s$. That is</p>
<p>$$\text{Sample Variance }=\text{ }s^{2}$$</p>

<h2 id="numerical-graphical-techniques">Numerical Graphical Techniques</h2>
<p>Another early step in the analysis of data is the construction of <strong>graphical summaries</strong>, which represent the data using a picture designed to highlight key attributes. One of the most important tools for analyzing numerical data is a <strong>histogram.</strong> A histogram is a type of bar chart that divides the total range of the data into a number of &ldquo;bins&rdquo; of equal width and then sorts the data into the bins based upon those ranges. It answers the questions about 1). center (Where do the numbers tend to concentrate?), 2). spread (How variable is the data?) and 3). shape (In what pattern do the data tend to fall?)</p>
<p>Figure 
<a href="#calls">[calls]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;calls&rdquo;}  below is an example of a histogram made from a set of waiting times (in minutes) for a technical support call center during a specific shift. From this chart, a supervisor could learn quite a lot about the customer service process. It seems most of the time, people are being served fairly quickly and the general pattern is that very short waiting times are common (notice that the tallest bar is above the $0-2$ range, and the bars decrease in height systematically from left to right). This pattern is precisely what a customer service supervisor wants to see! Were the pattern reversed (with small bars over small waiting times and large bars over large waiting times), the call center would need to be investigated to determine why customers are having to wait so long for service.</p>
<p>Another graphical tool for numerical data is the <strong>box plot.</strong> This plot typically shows five numbers: the minimum value, the $25^{th}$ percentile, the median (or $50^{th}$ percentile), the $75^{th}$ percentile, and the maximum value<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The $25^{th}$ percentile is the number $x_{0.25}$ such that (approximately) $25%$ of the data falls below it and (approximately) $75%$ of the data falls above it. In general, the $p^{th}$ percentile is a number $x_{p}$ that splits the data such that (approximately) $p%$ of the data falls below it and $(100-p)%$ of the data falls above it. **Outliers** , data values that are extremely small or large compared to the rest of the data, are typically plotted separately. Figure 
<a href="#boxplot">[boxplot]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;boxplot&rdquo;} displays the waiting time data. From this plot, we can see that about $25%$ of the data falls below $0.75$ minutes$,$ about $50%$ falls below $1.5$ minutes, and about $75%$ falls below $4$ minutes. The largest non-outlier waiting time was about $9$ minutes, and one unlucky soul had to wait over $12$ minutes!</p>
<h2 id="probability-distributions">Probability Distributions</h2>
<p>The mathematical concept of <strong>probability theory</strong> forms the basis of all statistical inference. It allows us to &ldquo;make the leap&rdquo; from the sample we have to the population or process that we are trying to study.  In order for us to be able to talk about statistics in an efficient way, we must agree upon some definitions. In this section, we will review some concepts that you should be familiar with from earlier classes.</p>
<p>A <strong>random variable</strong> $X$ is a numerical or categorical characteristic of a population or process whose range of possible values is known or assumed but for which the values are subject to random (or &ldquo;chance&rdquo;) variation.</p>
<p>Any letter of the alphabet can be used to indicate a random variable. The most common choices are $X$, $Z$, and $Y$. The name of the random variable is written in capital letters, while a specific value that the random variable takes on is written in lowercase.</p>
<p>[[5k]]{#5k label=&quot;5k&rdquo;}Let $X$ be number of people out of $30$ who finish a $5$K race. This is a random variable before the race occurs because we cannot say with certainty how many people will ultimately finish. We know that the possible values are ${0,1,2,\ldots ,30}$. If it turns out that $25$ people finish, then $x=25$.</p>
<h3 id="example-accidents">Example: Accidents</h3>
<p>Let $V$ be the number of accidents that occur on a particular length of highway on a Tuesday between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Before this time period occurs, $V$ is a random variable because we cannot say with certainty how many accidents will occur. We do know that the least number of accidents is $0,$ so we would say the possible values of $V$ are ${0,1,2,\ldots }$</p>
<h3 id="example-coffee">Example: Coffee</h3>
<p>Let $Y$ be the time (in seconds) you spend in line at a coffee shop on a Wednesday morning. This is a random variable before you visit the coffee shop. The smallest possible wait time is $0,$ while the largest possible time is not clearly defined without more assumptions. If you decide that you will leave, with coffee or without, if the wait is more than $15$ minutes, then the range of possible values is $0\leq y\leq 900$. If on this particular trip you wait $350.96$ seconds, then $y=350.96$, or about $5$ minutes and $51$ seconds.</p>
<h3 id="example-weight">Example: Weight</h3>
<p>Let $W$ be the number of pounds lost for an adult male over a six-week period of following a particular exercise program. This is a random variable before the six-week period is over because we cannot say for certain what the weight loss will be. We do know that it is possible to gain weight (through building muscle, for example) or to lose weight. Here it is a bit more difficult to assign a range to the random variable without knowing more about the study, but one reasonable choice would be $-35\leq y\leq 55$ ($-35$ implies that it is possible to gain $35$ pounds). If a particular man loses $35.4$ pounds, then $w=35.4$.</p>
<p>Here are some additional important definitions.</p>
<p>A <strong>probability,</strong> in practical (i.e., non-mathematically formal) terms can be thought of as a chance of something happening. The range of a valid probability for an event is $0$ (no chance of the event occurring) to $1$ (guaranteed for the event to occur). Probabilities cannot be negative.</p>
<p>A <strong>discrete random variable</strong> is a random variable whose entire set of values and associated probabilities can be completely listed or at least counted.</p>
<p>Examples 
<a href="#5k">[5k]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;5k&rdquo;} and 
<a href="#accidents">[accidents]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;accidents&rdquo;} above involve discrete random variables because the possibilities can be completely listed (example 
<a href="#5k">[5k]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;5k&rdquo;}) or counted 
<a href="#accidents">[accidents]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;accidents&rdquo;}.</p>
<p>A <strong>continuous random variable</strong> is a random variable whose entire set of values cannot be listed because the possible values extend, in theory, to an infinite number of decimal places.</p>
<p>Examples 
<a href="#coffee">[coffee]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;coffee&rdquo;} and 
<a href="#weight">[weight]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;weight&rdquo;} above involve continuous random variables because time and weight are measurements that can take on, in theory, an infinite number of decimal places depending upon how precise our measurement instruments are.</p>
<p>Once we have defined a random variable, we need some way to assign the probabilities to its values. In general, how we do this depends on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous. There is some highly technical mathematics involved in that we are going to skip right over in favor of the following definition:</p>
<p>A <strong>probability distribution</strong> is a specification of the possible values of a random variable and their associated probabilities, made either by listing the possible values and their probabilities or by providing a function that gives probabilities for a collection of possible values of the random variable.</p>
<p>When we write $P(X=x),$ this stands for &ldquo;the probability that the random variable $X$ equals $x,&ldquo;$ or, more simply, &ldquo;the probability that $X$ equals $x.&ldquo;$ For example, $P(X=4),$ referring to example 
<a href="#5k">[5k]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;5k&rdquo;} above, would be read as &ldquo;the probability that $X=4,&ldquo;$ which in context is the probability that $4$ runners finish the $5K$ run.</p>
<p>In general, how we assign probabilities depends on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous. Discrete probability distributions can be specified as two-column tables listing the possible values of the random variable and their associated probabilities, or by writing a function that outputs probabilities. Continuous random variables must be specified by writing a function $f(y)$ and the outputs of these functions are not probabilities, but &ldquo;relative likelihoods&rdquo; of various values.</p>
<p>A discrete probability distribution for a random variable $X$ must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>$\sum_{all\text{ }x}P(X=x)=1$  [probabilities must sum to $1$]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$0\leq P(X=x)\leq 1$ for all $x$ [probabilities are between $0$ and $1]$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A continuous distribution for a random variable $Y$ must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>$f(y)\geq 0$ for all possible $y$   [graph of the function is above the horizontal axis]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total area under the curve $f(y)=1$</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Referring to example 
<a href="#5k">[5k]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;5k&rdquo;}, one way to define the probability distribution of $X$ would be to list the values of $x$ and their probabilities as in Table 
<a href="#TableKey">[TableKey]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;TableKey&rdquo;} below (the three dots notation, $\vdots$ ,means that the rows between $3$ and $29$ have been left out for space reasons)$$. Note that the probabilities listed are just examples.</p>

<p>All of the probabilities above must be between $0$ and $1$ , and they must add up to exactly $1$. Another way to define this distribution would be to use a function. If we assume that each runner has the same probability of &ldquo;success&rdquo; $p$ (finishing the race) and that they perform independently of other runners, we might use the binomial distribution to describe the probabilities of $x$ number of runners finishing:</p>
<p>$$P(X=x)=\frac{30!}{(30-x)!x!}p^{x}(1-p)^{30-x}$$</p>
<p>where the symbol $&rdquo;!&ldquo;$ denotes the factorial function (for example $5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1)$.</p>
<p>Referring to example 
<a href="#weight">[weight]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;weight&rdquo;}, we might assume that the amount of weight lost could be described by a bell-shaped curve with a peak value at $10$ pounds, such as the one in Figure 
<a href="#wt_dist">[wt_dist]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;wt_dist&rdquo;}.</p>
<p>The particular function that produces this graph is</p>
<p>$$f(y)=\frac{1}{15\sqrt{2\pi }}e^{\frac{-(y-10)^{2}}{450}}$$</p>
<p>The graph meets the criterion that it must lie above the horizontal axis. Further, if you were to use calculus to find the area under the curve, it would be exactly $1$. The distribution shown in Figure 
<a href="#wt_dist">[wt_dist]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;wt_dist&rdquo;} is known as the normal distribution, and we will be seeing it again and again.</p>
<p>Many times, a histogram of the data can suggest a particular probability distribution. Look again at Figure 
<a href="#calls">[calls]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;calls&rdquo;}, which shows the distribution of waiting times at a call center. This &ldquo;downstairs&rdquo; pattern suggests another widely used continuous probability distribution called the exponential distribution. Figure 
<a href="#exp_dist">[exp_dist]</a>{reference-type=&quot;ref&rdquo; reference=&quot;exp_dist&rdquo;}  shows the exponential distribution drawn over the histogram.</p>
<p>Once we have a random variable and its distribution, we can talk about its properties. The two most common properties to examine are its mean ( <strong>expected</strong> or average) value and its degree of variability (variance or standard deviation). We will only look at the definitions of these quantities for the discrete case because integral calculus is required to define them for continuous random variables.</p>
<p>The <strong>expected value</strong> (or <strong>mean)</strong> of a discrete random variable $X,$ denoted by either $E(X)$ or $\mu$ (and pronounced &ldquo;mu&rdquo;)$,$ is defined as</p>
<p>$$\mu =E(X)=\sum_{all\text{ }x}xP(X=x)$$</p>
<p>That is, it is a weighted (by the probabilities) sum of the possible values of the random variable.</p>
<p>The <strong>variance</strong> of a discrete random variable $X,$ denoted by either $V(X)$ or $\sigma ^{2}$ (and pronounced &ldquo;sigma squared&rdquo;) is defined as</p>
<p>$$V(X)=\sum_{all\text{ }x}(x-\mu )^{2}P(X=x)$$</p>
<p>A shortcut formula is
$$E(X^{2})-[E(X)]^{2}$$</p>
<p>The standard deviation, denoted as either $StDev(X)$ or $\sigma$ (read as &ldquo;sigma&rdquo;)$,$ is defined as $\sqrt{V(X)}$.</p>
<p>Basically, $E(X)$ is the population version of $\overline{x}$ and $V(X)$ is the population version of $s^{2}$.</p>
<p>The following facts will come in handy later.</p>
<p>(math fact) If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables and $a$ and $b$ are any constants (fixed values), then all of the following statements about expected value and variance are true:</p>
<p>$$\begin{gathered} E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b \ E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y) \ V(aX+b)=a^{2}V(X) \ V(aX+bY)=a^{2}V(X)+b^{2}V(Y)+2ab\rho StDev(X)StDev(Y)\end{gathered}$$</p>
<p>That is, you get to pull the constants out in front of the mean and variance operators, but with variance you square the constant while with expected value, you just pull it out. The mean of a constant is just the constant, while the variance of a constant is $0$.</p>
<p>The Greek letter $\rho$ is pronounced &ldquo;row&rdquo; and describes the <strong>correlation</strong> (or linear relationship) between two numerical variables. We will return to this concept toward the end of the course.</p>
<p>The following questions address the topics above. Most, if not all, of these questions are review from BANA 2372.</p>
<ol>
<li>The General Social Survey asked the following question : In the last 12 months, how many times have you been injured on the job?</li>

<li>(Real-world application). A potential customer for a $50,000$ fire insurance policy has a home in an area that, according to past experience, may sustain a total loss in a given year with a probability of $0.001$ and a $50%$ loss with a probability of $0.01$. There is a $0.989$ chance that the customer will make no claim in the coverage year. The company also offers renter&rsquo;s insurance. This same potential customer wants a $20,000$ policy. Based on historical data the company has for the area, the probability of a total loss due to fire is $0.005,$ the probability of a $50%$ loss is $0.015,$ and the probability of no loss is $0.98$. Let $X$ be the company&rsquo;s loss on the fire insurance policy and $Y$ be the company&rsquo;s loss on the renter&rsquo;s insurance policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>a). Find the expected loss for the fire policy and for the renter&rsquo;s insurance policy individually. That is, find $E(X)$ and $E(Y)$.</p>
<p>b). Find the combined expected loss for the company on the two policies. That is, find $E(X+Y)$.</p>
<p>c). Suppose the company combines the premiums for the two policies and charges $600$ per year. Based on your answer to (b), is this a good business decision for the company?</p>
<p>d). Suppose the company offers the fire policy to $20$ customers and the renter&rsquo;s insurance to $10$ customers in the same area. Find the combined expected loss for the company, assuming each customer has identical loss probabilities. That is, Find $E(20X+10Y)$.</p>
<h2 id="binomial-distribution">Binomial Distribution</h2>
<p>In this section, we review in more detail one of the most important discrete distributions.</p>
<p>The binomial distribution is used to model the situation in which there are $n$ identical trials or experiments and you want to know the chance of getting $x$ &ldquo;successes&rdquo; or &ldquo;events&rdquo; out of those $n$ trials when the probability of success is known to be $p$. If $X$ has the binomial distribution, then</p>
<p>$$P(X=x)=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}$$</p>
<p>where $!$ is the factorial operation. For example $5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1$.</p>
<p>This can also be written as</p>
<p>$$P(X=x)=\binom{n}{x}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}$$</p>
<p>where $\binom{n}{x}=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}$ and is read as &ldquo;$n$ choose $x$&rdquo;</p>

Suppose the company receives a batch of $50$ bottles and finds that $2$ bottles contain defective product.</li>
</ol>
<p>a). What is the probability that Umbrella would find exactly $2$ defective bottles in a shipment of $50$, if the real defect rate is $0.01$ as promised?</p>

Out of those $7$ people, $3$ said they liked Low-Brau&rsquo;s light beer the best. The taste test was &ldquo;blind&rdquo; in that the volunteers did not know beforehand which of the $7$ beers they tasted was Low-Brau&rsquo;s. If there is no difference in the taste of the light beers, what is the chance that $3$ out of $7$ people would be able to rate Low-Brau&rsquo;s as the best?</p>

<h1 id="histograms">Histograms</h1>
<p>A histogram is a bar graph that represents the frequency distribution of a dataset. It is a way to visualize a pattern in a numerical data set. It answers the questions about</p>
<ol>
<li>Center (where the numbers tend to fall)</li>
<li>Spread (the degree of variability in the data) and</li>
<li>Shape (the pattern in which the numbers tend to fall)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A histogram can be used to estimate continuous probability distributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Properties of a histogram:</p>
<ol>
<li>Horizontal scale measures the data values</li>
<li>Vertical scale measures the frequencies of the bins</li>
<li>Consecutive bars touch</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="histogram-example-call-durations">Histogram Example: Call Durations</h1>
<p>Suppose you work at a call center for a cable company. Your job is to help customers troubleshoot their technology problems. Many people are bad with technology, and so the call center stays busy. Your manager wants to make sure that people aren’t on hold for too long; otherwise they might bail and go to another provider. Your department keeps track of the hold times for customers. Each week, your manager reviews the data to see if changes need to be made. To do this, she makes a histogram of the duration times, which we will call Y.</p>
<p>Here we see that most customers get served pretty quickly (the times between 0 and 2 are far more frequent). However, some customers have to wait a lot longer.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to find the probability that a customer has to wait between 1 and 4 minutes for service. How can we do that?</p>
<p><img src="img/Continuous-Distributions_CURRENT0.png" alt="phone graph"></p>
<p>It looks like we might be able to fit a smooth curve to the histogram. For N = 100 calls, it doesn’t fit so well, but for n = 10,000 calls, it gets better.</p>
<p>This smooth curve is an example of a continuous distribution function, and using it, we can find the probabilities that a caller has to wait between 1 and 4 minutes.</p>

<td>Continuous Distributions</td>
<td>A distribution for a continuous random variable, say, Y, is written as f(y). It is a smooth function with points on the curve indicating “relative likelihoods” of observations. It must meet two criteria: 1. f(y) ≥ 0 for all possible values that the random variable can take on. 2. The total area under the curve is exactly 1. Probabilities are calculated as areas under the curve.</td>
